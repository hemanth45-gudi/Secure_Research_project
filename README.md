Project Name : Secure Research Dataset Sharing System with Time-Limited Access

Secure Research Portal is a Flask-based web application for securely managing and sharing research datasets. It implements multi-factor authentication (password + email OTP), role-based access control (Admin, Researcher, Reviewer), and hybrid encryption using AES and RSA. Passwords are protected using SHA-256 hashing with salt, and digital signatures ensure data integrity and authenticity. MongoDB is used for secure storage of users, datasets, and activity logs.
