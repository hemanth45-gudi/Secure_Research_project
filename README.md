# [START] Secure Research Dataset Sharing System with Time-Limited Access

##   Project Description

The **Secure Research Dataset Sharing System** is a web-based platform designed to securely share sensitive research datasets with controlled and time-limited access. The system ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authorized usage through strong authentication, hybrid encryption techniques, and role-based access control.

It enables researchers to upload datasets securely, allows authorized users to access them within a defined time period, and ensures secure communication using AES and RSA encryption with SHA-256 hashing for password protection.

This platform is ideal for academic institutions, research organizations, and secure data-sharing environments where privacy and controlled access are critical.
